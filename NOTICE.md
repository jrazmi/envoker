NOTICE: The design philosophy and many core packages are taken directly from Bill Kennedy and his Go course at ardanlabs.com. (github.com/ardanlabs/service) I have made modifcations and changes to just about all that I borrowed from Bill to fit the use case here. I have differed from him on certain philosophies and organization. Regardless of my misguided changes, I highly recommend you checkout his course. Ardan Labs published their service repository under the apache 2 license, listed below.
